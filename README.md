This plugin scans all your notes in the vault to find and fix improperly linked embedded images.

> **Note**: This plugin was prepared for publication by Gemini.

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin scans all your notes in the vault to find and fix a very specific formatting issue: **improperly linked embedded images**.

Sometimes, when you copy and paste content, an embedded image link like `![[image.png]]` can get wrapped in an extra markdown link, resulting in broken code that looks like this:

```markdown
[![[image.png]](/some/unnecessary/path)]
```

This plugin automatically finds all occurrences of this pattern and corrects them back to the simple, valid format:

```markdown
![[image.png]]
```

### Key Features:

*   **Vault-Wide Scan:** Fixes all markdown files in your entire vault with a single command.
*   **Automatic Backups:** Before modifying any file, the plugin creates a backup of the original version in a dedicated backup folder. You can configure the location of this folder in the plugin's settings.
*   **Ribbon Icon & Command:** You can run the fix process either by clicking the wand icon in the left ribbon or by using the "Fix Embed Links: Fix embedded links" command from the command palette.
*   **Detailed Summary:** After the process is complete, you will receive a notification summarizing how many files were scanned, how many were fixed, and the total number of corrections made.
